     -----SMART FARM-----

The proposed web application is designed to support agronomists, future investors, and large plantation owners by providing essential information to maintain the health and productivity of their farms.
Here are the key features of the app:

Environmental Monitoring:
Temperature: Real-time data on the temperature levels within the closed farm environments.
CO2 Levels: Continuous monitoring of CO2 levels to ensure optimal conditions for plant growth.
Light: Measurement and tracking of light intensity to ensure plants receive the necessary amount of light for photosynthesis.

Plant Health Diagnostics:
Disease Detection: Identification and reporting of any diseases affecting the plants. This feature will likely include diagnostic tools that can detect common plant diseases through visual, environmental, or sensor data.

Preventive Recommendations:
Guidance: Providing actionable recommendations and best practices to prevent the loss of plants.
